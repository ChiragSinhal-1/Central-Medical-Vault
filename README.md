```bash 
$ sudo apt update
```

To install pip3 run the command:
```bash 
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```
### Install all python libraries on Virtual Machine:
Install python flask

```bash 
  pip install python3 flask
  cd my-project
```
### Install Git
Use the following steps to install Git on Ubuntu Linux system. 

Install the software-properties-common package on your system, which contains add-apt-repository command

### Clone the existing project

```bash 
 git clone "project_url"
```

### Run the python server and open VM-ipaddress:5000 in your browser.

Command to open port 5000 of your virtual machine is as follows:

First, you should disable selinux, edit file /etc/sysconfig/selinux so it looks like this: SELINUX=disabled SELINUXTYPE=targeted

Then you can add the new rule to iptables:

```
bash iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
